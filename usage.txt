Testing with Different Inputs
Hereâ€™s how the inputs would affect the house price prediction:

-> IF YOU WANT TO INCREASE THE PRICE
Increasing RM (more rooms), decreasing LSTAT (lower status population), and increasing ZN (more residential land) will increase the predicted price.

-> IF YOU WANT TO DECREASE THE PRICE
Increasing CRIM (crime rate), increasing AGE (older houses), and increasing LSTAT (more lower-status population) will decrease the predicted price.
